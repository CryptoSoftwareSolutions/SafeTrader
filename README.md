# SafeTrader

[![Demo Example](https://safetrader.io)]

SafeTrader is opensource and freeware software which aims to provide an extensive toolset for bitcoin traders. Currently the script supports Localbitcoins.com only, but more trading platforms will be added in the near future.

The scriptlet comes in the form of a bookmarklet which you can use to expand the features on any Localbitcoins page with a simple click.

## Features

* Keep the green light on automatically.
* Gain access to browse the scammer database and add to it.
* Do a lookup on your trading partner to see if they can be trusted.
* Check out your own hidden feedback.
* Check out the hidden feedback of others.
* Search multiple pages of ads on one page.
* Find out which feedbacks were written from the same account.
* Find out who visited your profile recently.
* Show trade messages in reverse time order for sharing a chat.
* Update the price to match others automatically, even when you're away!

### Installation

SafeTrader requires no software installation. Just drag & drop it to your bookmarks toolbar and click it when you are on a Localbitcoins page.

### Enabling the Bookmarks toolbar

If you do not see the Bookmarks toolbar in your browser, press Ctrl+B.

_Please note that while we try to take as much care as possible to extract
the right information, the ultimate decision to trust the other party should
be taken in consideration based not solely on the data obtained by the app_
